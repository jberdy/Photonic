		<p>I first started researching the craft brewing industry in 2014 as part of my community development project for the Oregon Tech Honors Program. The initial concept was to start a brewpub on the Oregon Tech campus. I shifted the focus in 2015 to make one ingredient used in beer: malt. The concept with malt was to use Klamath Falls grown grain to create craft malt to sell to microbrewers. Whenever I would tell someone about the malt project they would say "oh that's cool, well let me know when you have samples to taste test!" I realized that the community in Klamath Falls still has a growing appetite for craft beer beyond the options currently available. My vision is to open a craft brewery in Klamath Falls that would highlight the best of what the community has to offer.</p>
